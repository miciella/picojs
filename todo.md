## Goals

Try to implement a tiny language but full dev stack.

- JS is our C++
- no dependencies
- pico JS implementation
- it's fun and easy to follow

## Stream 1

- [x] simple lexer (tokenazier)
- [x] context aware errors for lexer

## Stream 2

- [x] simple parser (produces AST)
- [x] context aware errors for parser

## Stream 3

- [x] just test things as they are

## Stream 4

- [x] add operator precedence

## Stream 5

- [x] add suport for both division and regexps
- [x] add suport for comments

## Stream 6

- [x] remove logging ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- [x] do some refactoring
- [x] implement AST evaluator
- [x] context aware errors for evaluator
- [x] implement some simple exception logic

## Stream 7

- [x] primitive type checking

## Stream 8

- [x] finish the refactoring
- [ ] add some syntax highlighting

## Later

- [ ] extend lexer and parser with conditionals
- [ ] bytecode emission and execution
- [ ] implement some more complex exception propagation
- [ ] babel-like transformations and code emition
- [ ] VSCode language server
- [ ] try bison in JS
- [ ] emit WASM friendly output
- [ ] try true exceptions
- [ ] maybe something like core rewrite as in prettier
